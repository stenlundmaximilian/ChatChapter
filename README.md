# ChatChapter
This code is for a website that makes it easier to create short stories using Chat GPTs API. The website works by creating prompts automatically by having parts of the prompt predefined and by creating parts of the prompts from characters and environments created by the user which are stored in a database using MongoDB. By combining different characters and environments from the database there are endless possibilities for creating different short stories easily. The website also automatically creates images for the stories from the prompts by using a stable diffusion API.
